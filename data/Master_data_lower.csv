","in time tec built a mobile application that brought the whole system online. the app allows members to register, check in, and track events they attend for continuing education credits. instead of remembering to manually track credits, members now just scan a qr code when they arrive at an event and their attendance is tracked for credit.

","in time tec built a custom tool to compare the data automatically. every week, we ran tests. they would pass or fail and we would offer solutions for the failed tests.

care professionals to continually improve early  care and education practices
challenge : idahostars used to rely on paper-based  systems to complete coaching, training,  licensing, and record keeping. this resulted in  a slow turn-around time–ranging from weeks  to months–for child care providers to get  licensed. the way the data was stored also  contributed to lengthy turnaround times.  having five disconnected databases meant  that an update in one resulted in a manual  update in the remaining four. permission  restrictions were a blocker as well. only  select users could access the data, creating  bottlenecks in the workflows and to top it all  off, the software idahostars had been using  for years was soon to be obsolete.","in time tec created rise, a web application  (integrated with ux/ui best practices) that  was easier to access, easier to use, more  intuitive, and more reliable. rise consolidates  the data in one place for robust, dynamic  reporting that is consistent for every process.  it also gives customers access and control of  their own data. we focused on optimizing the  workflow so idahostars could provide the  value, training, and advice they were looking  to provide in order to improve the education  experience for young kids. 
","created a web development team for  idahostars so we can support them to  roll out new features. 
provided a five-person offshore team to  work closely with idahostars. 
rise has processed, approved, and paid  trainers for 800+ scholarships within the  first year. 
minimized turn-around time by 4-6 weeks for child care provider licensing and  
incentives.
