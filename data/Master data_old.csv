They knew they had built plenty of security and defenses and needed someone to validate their testing.","In Time Tec essentially hacked their application in an effort to try to break or compromise it and share vulnerabilities with the client. We were able to bypass a lot of their existing defenses and showed them gaps for exploitations.

, Automating Production Monitoring,,PDF-Case Study,Data Science,Healthcare Technology,A healthcare technology company was manually checking multiple dash- boards for multiple clients everyday to monitor their software system health. Technologists were spending three to four hours a day monitoring all the dashboards and creating tickets to address issues.,In Time Tec created a team of onshore developers to work with the company's existing team and decrease the manual production monitoring. Our team created an API call from App Insights through Azure into a Python script; the analysis is run in Python and flagged when there is an issue; a Jira ticket is then created for the issue. ,"By working with In Time Tec, this company was able to decrease time spent on manual monitoring and ticketing, getting back at least 15 hours of working time a week.

Members would attend an event to get credits, get a piece of paper that would show the credits, and then manually enter credits in the non-profits existing system. Many people were forgetting to log or logging incorrect data and there was too much room for inaccuracies. ","In Time Tec built a mobile application that brought the whole system online.

","In Time Tec came alongside the client and added onshore and offshore QA engineers to their existing teams. When the client's developers had finished coding, our engineers did an intense and thorough run-through of the application to ensure the expected results were produced.

, Automated Data Validation,,PDF-Case Study,Test Automation,AgriBusiness,"Our client, an agribusiness, was migrating from an old tech, Data Manager scheduler and SQL stored procedures, to the new tech, Control-M Scheduler and Microsoft SSIS Packages. They wanted to make sure that the new tool was operating the same way as the older tool. It was of the utmost importance that nothing was changed or lost in the migration. The way to ensure this was to run both tools and compare the data. The client knew it was a near impossible task for a human to compare the millions of rows of data. 
","In Time Tec built a custom tool to compare the data automatically. Every week, we ran tests. They would pass or fail and we would offer solutions for the failed tests. ","We were able to alleviate the tediousness of someone manually comparing the data from one tool to another.

They needed a portal for clients to manage the contracts, renewals, and requests for new equipment. Initially, the technologists designed the tool from the client requests, which often meant that no one talked about UI design. This led to miscommunications about the look and feel of the portal and work was often redone. ",In Time Tec brought a UI designer onto the client's team. This person was responsible for mocking up the design of the tool before the developers even began to code. They worked directly with both the client and the developers to ensure everyone was on the same page for the vision of the portal,"ON BRAND: 
The new portal was on brand for the client's other tools and marketing. 
MORE TIME EFFICIENCY: Saved both the client & developers time by introducing a designer to mock up features before they were coded, instead of the client wanting changes after. CREATED CLARITY:

,Idaho Stars,,,,,"IdahoSTARS is the leading expert and resource  for quality child care in Idaho. They empower  parents and early childhood professionals to  make safe, healthy, nurturing, and educational  child care a top priority. They support child  
care professionals to continually improve early  care and education practices
Challenge : IdahoSTARS used to rely on paper-based  systems to complete coaching, training,  licensing, and record keeping. This resulted in  a slow turn-around time–ranging from weeks  to months–for child care providers to get  licensed. The way the data was stored also  contributed to lengthy turnaround times.  Having five disconnected databases meant  that an update in one resulted in a manual  update in the remaining four. Permission  restrictions were a blocker as well. Only  select users could access the data, creating  bottlenecks in the workflows and to top it all  off, the software IdahoSTARS had been using  for years was soon to be obsolete.","In Time Tec created RISE, a web application  (integrated with UX/UI best practices) that  was easier to access, easier to use, more  intuitive, and more reliable. RISE consolidates  the data in one place for robust, dynamic  reporting that is consistent for every process.  It also gives customers access and control of  their own data. We focused on optimizing the  workflow so IdahoSTARS could provide the  value, training, and advice they were looking  to provide in order to improve the education  experience for young kids. 
","Created a web development team for  IdahoSTARS so we can support them to  roll out new features. 
Provided a five-person offshore team to  work closely with IdahoSTARS. 
RISE has processed, approved, and paid  trainers for 800+ scholarships within the  first year. 
Minimized turn-around time by 4-6 weeks for child care provider licensing and  
incentives. 
Gave providers control over their personal administrative tasks freeing up RISE coaches  to focus on coaching instead of processes. IdahoSTARS is no longer the gatekeeper of  the provider’s information. 
Planning to create a mobile-friendly 
application of RISE giving access to  
providers in the palm of their hands.

,Transparent IDAHO,,,,,"The Idaho legislature passed a bill that required local government financial data be available  on the State Controller’s Transparent Idaho  website. The State Controller’s Office 
(SCO) faced three significant challenges with  implementing this bill, in addition to a very  short deadline for completion. A large volume  of data from over 1,300 state entities had to be  imported and organized. The second challenge  - creating a website where the information  was easily accessed and clearly understood  by Idaho citizens. The third challenge - SCO’s  technical teams were already focused on other  important projects and could not develop the  website within the required time frames. They  needed to find a partner with the expertise to create the solution, augment their team, and drive the project to completion. 
","In Time Tec’s technical teams partnered with  SCO on this project. Our UX/UI design team  conducted field studies, focus groups, and  additional user research to ensure that the  website was intuitive and full-featured. In Time  Tec’s data engineering and analytics team  modeled the large volume of data from Idaho's  1300 local entities to create easy-to-understand  visuals and reports that meet the requirements  of the Local Transparency initiative. Our web  development team used the design and data  analytic features to create a user-friendly, fully  responsive website which provides detailed  financial information and promotes trust  in government. The Idaho State Controller’s  challenges were addressed, the state achieved  its goal of providing transparent financial  reporting, and In Time Tec successfully  partnered with SCO to complete the project on  time and on budget. 
","Engineered user interface to access over 1,300  local government entities’ unique data with an  interactive, visually engaging, web-based platform
